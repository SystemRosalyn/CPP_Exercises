# Welcome to CPP_Exercises

I am reading this book to accelerate my career into Information Security and Technology, specifically from the systems programming perspective. As of creating this repository, I understand basic C, but I feel like I would want to learn more with C++ especially since I can create much more dynamic applications and tools using the object-oriented paradigm from a systems context.
